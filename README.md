# Module-2-VBA-Challenge

## Quarterly Stock Analysis (VBA Script)

## About
This project is part of my Data Science course at SMU, where Iâ€™m learning how to apply programming to analyze and process data. 
The purpose of this VBA script is to analyze stock data on a quarterly basis and calculate some important metrics:
- **Ticker**: The stock identifier.
- **Quarterly Change**: The difference in stock price from the start to the end of the quarter.
- **Percent Change**: The percent increase or decrease during the quarter.
- **Total Stock Volume**: The total number of shares traded during the quarter.
- **Greatest % Increase**: The greatest percent increase in the quarter
- **Greatest % Decrease**: The greatest percent decrease in the quarter
- **Greatest Total Volume**: The greatest total volume in the quarter

## What You Need
- Microsoft Excel with VBA enabled.
- A dataset with the following columns:
  - **Ticker symbol** in Column A 
  - **Dates** In Column B
  - **Opening prices** in Column C
  - **High Prices** in Column D
  - **Low Prices** in column E
  - **Closing prices** in column F
  - **Trading volumes** in Column G
- Each Sheet should only contain data for a signle quarter
    
## How to Use
1. Open your Excel file and press `Alt + F11` to access the VBA editor.
2. Insert a new module by right-clicking on the workbook and selecting **Insert > Module**.
3. Copy and paste the script into the module.
4. Save your file as a macro-enabled workbook (`.xlsm`).
5. To run the script:
   - Press `Alt + F8` in Excel.
   - Select the macro (e.g., `QuarterlyStockAnalysis`) and click **Run**.
6. The output will be displayed in the same sheet starting from column I.

## Example
- Please refer to the screenshot provided for an example of the input data structure and expected output.

## Learning Experience
This project has been a great way to:
- Practice VBA for data manipulation and analysis.
- Work with financial datasets and derive meaningful insights.
- Develop coding skills in a structured environment as part of my course at SMU.
